##Description
Wordle was created by software engineer and former Reddit employee, Josh Wardle, and was launched in October 2021.

##How to play wordle
You have 6 tries to guess a five letter word. The word may contain duplicate letters such as "hello".
After each guess, the color of the letter will change to show how close your guess was to the actual answer.
After a successful guess or 6 unsuccessful tries, you will see a message.

##Notes
To try and play, download all the files including the words.txt
Once thats done, run the wordle.cpp using the terminal or your favourite IDE.
